## This Tableau project appears to be a dashboard comparing country codes and average birth rates with internet usage by country. Here's a breakdown based on the visible elements:

### Title:
The dashboard seems to focus on two main comparisons: 
#### "COUNTRY CODE VS AVG BIRTH RATE" and "COUNTRY NAME VS INTERNET."
#### Map (Top): 
The map visualizes birth rates across the world. Darker shades of blue likely indicate higher birth rates, while lighter shades indicate lower birth rates. This is the "COUNTRY CODE VS AVG BIRTH RATE" part of the dashboard.
#### Bar Chart (Bottom): 
The bar chart displays internet usage percentages for various countries. The length of each bar corresponds to the percentage of the population with internet access. This represents the "COUNTRY NAME VS INTERNET" part.
#### Filters: 
There are visible filters for "Country Code" and "Income Group," suggesting the user can interactively filter the data displayed on the map and potentially the bar chart as well.
#### Layout: 
The layout is set to a custom size (1000 x 900 pixels). There's also a "Phone" layout option, indicating the dashboard is designed to be responsive and viewable on mobile devices.
#### Objects Pane: 
This pane lists the various elements on the dashboard, including containers (for organizing elements), text boxes, extensions, and the data visualizations themselves. It also indicates whether objects are "Tiled" (fixed position) or "Floating" (can be moved freely).
### In summary:
The project aims to explore potential correlations between birth rates and internet access across different countries. By using a map and a bar chart, the dashboard provides a visual comparison of these two variables, allowing users to filter the data by country code and income group.
